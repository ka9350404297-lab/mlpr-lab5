# MLPR Lab 5 – Face Clustering using K-Means

##  Aim
To detect faces from an image and perform clustering based on Hue and Saturation values using K-Means algorithm.

##  Methodology
- Used OpenCV Haar Cascade for face detection
- Extracted HSV color features (Hue, Saturation)
- Applied K-Means clustering
- Visualized clusters using matplotlib
- Mapped template image to predicted cluster

##  Key Findings
- Faces were grouped into 2 clusters based on color features.
- Template image successfully mapped to closest cluster.
- Hue and Saturation provide simple but effective clustering.

##  Results
(Add screenshots of output graphs here)

## Conclusion
K-Means clustering can group facial regions using simple color features.
However, accuracy depends on lighting and feature extraction quality.
